# Rainfall Prediction using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

## Overview
This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques for predicting rainfall based on various weather parameters. The model is deployed using MLOps practices to ensure scalability, reliability, and ease of maintenance. A Flask-based web interface allows users to interact with the model by inputting relevant data and receiving rainfall predictions.

## Features
- **Advanced Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes state-of-the-art algorithms for accurate rainfall prediction.
- **MLOps Integration**: Ensures seamless deployment, version control, monitoring, and updates of the model.
- **Flask Web Application**: A user-friendly interface for interacting with the model and entering input values.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Provides fast and accurate rainfall predictions.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle increasing amounts of data and user interactions.

## Project Architecture
1. **Data Collection**: Historical weather data is collected from reliable sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data undergoes cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
3. **Model Training**: Advanced machine learning models are trained using preprocessed data.
4. **MLOps Pipeline**: Includes CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and cloud deployment.
5. **Web Interface**: A Flask application for user interaction and input.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Machine Learning & Visualization Libraries**: seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
- **MLOps Tools**: Docker, MLflow
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Frontend Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS/GCP/Azure (optional based on deployment)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- Docker (for containerization)
- MLflow (for model tracking)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Partha-Guntur/Rainfall-Prediction-using-MLOps.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd rainfall-prediction
   ```
3. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up the Flask application:
   ```bash
   export FLASK_APP=app.py
   flask run
   ```
5. (Optional) Build and run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker build -t rainfall-prediction .
   docker run -p 5000:5000 rainfall-prediction
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Flask web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
2. Enter weather parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed) into the form.
3. Click on the **Predict** button to get the rainfall prediction.
